Descripion of dataset
---------------------

The data has 768 subjects, which it measures across 8 features. 
The measure as to whether a subject has diabetes is if the 2 hour post-load plasma glucose
 was at least 200 mg/dl at any survey. 
 
The class value is the target value. If a subject tested positive for Diabetes, then the class value is 1. 
A class value of 0 means that the subject did not test positive for Diabetes. 

Of the 768 subjects, there were 268 that tested positive for Diabetes.  


The dataset has no null value. 

There are 8 features. My understanding is that they are normalized as they have the same unit. 


In summary, the result I get, is that my knn accuracy score is 0.67 whereas my naive bayes score is 0.56. 

Did not do the average of 0,50. Did not read homework correctly on that one.
