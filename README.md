### Course Description
Foundational course in data science, including machine learning theory, case studies and real-world examples, introduction to various modeling techniques, and other tools to make predictions and decisions about data. Students will gain practical computational experience by running machine learning algorithms and learning how to choose the best and most representative data models to make predictions. Students will be using [Python](https://www.python.org/) throughout this course.

### Required Setup
- Own laptop
- [Continuum Analytics Anaconda python](http://continuum.io/downloads)
- [Git & Github](https://github.com/)

### Completion Requirements
In order to receive a General Assembly Certificate in Data Science, upon completion of the course, students must:

- Complete and submit 80% of all course assignments (homework, homework reviews, labs, quizzes). Students who miss more than 20% of assignments will not be eligible for the course certificate.
- Complete and subimt the course midterm test, earning a satisfactory grade.
- Complete and submit the course final project, earning a satisfactory grade by completing all functional and technical requirements on the project rubric, including delivering a presentation.
